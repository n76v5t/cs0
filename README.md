Project Milestone 1
CSC 261/461 Introduction to Databases
Introduction
For this project, you can choose to work in a team (max 3). You will be designing and implementing a simple database by applying the techniques and concepts covered in the course. You will eventually use MySQL for creating and querying your database, and PHP/HTML to create an interface accessible to the user and the administrator to access and/or interact with the database.
To make sure that your team is going in the right direction, we will set up multiple milestones, from the beginning to the end of the project (and the semester).
Milestone 1
You need to hand in a report which contains the overview of your project proposal. This overview can change slightly as we go over the course, but the main theme should be intact.
The proposal should consist of two (2) or more pages describing the problem you plan to solve, outlining how you plan to solve it, and describing what you will "deliver" for the final project. Your report should contain the following sections:
1. Project details: Name of your project, your team, and team members. Please include Team number 代 写CSC 261/461 Introduction to Databases Project Milestone 1
代做程序编程语言and Member ID from the google sheet.
2. Problem Statement: Describe the problem that your proposed database system will solve. Why do you need a database instead of an excel file?
3. Target user: Who will use your database? Who will administer the database? Give a real-life scenario and have at least 3 categories of users with different privileges.
4. List of Relations: Identify at least 5 relations (tables) that you need to maintain for this database. Provide schema (attributes and their data types) for each of these relations.
5. Web-interface: Provide rough sketches of the web-interfaces that you will design. Web interfaces are mainly ‘forms’ where a user can provide input, and based on the input, the tables are updated and/or query results are produced. This is the user interface (UI) of your project.
6. Data: How will you populate your relations? You can get the data from external sources or you can create your own data.
How to submit
Save your report as Milestone1.pdf and upload to Blackboard. Only the team leader (Member #1) needs to submit the file.
