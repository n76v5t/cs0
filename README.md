This course offers a comprehensive overview of what it means to study communications.

They will explore: communication theories, communication media, the key power players in the realm of communications (particularly in North America), and the role of the audience.

Tips for sharing feedback:o Use ‘sandwich feedback’: Start and end with positives. E.g., I really liked how the story…I appreciated this…o Avoid using: ‘You should …’ o Consider using: ‘If it were my assignment, I might…’o Ask questions: ‘Did you think about…?’o Be specific. Vague language won’t score points.
